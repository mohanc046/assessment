# Assessment

## Project Name

### Description

This project aims to provide functionalities related to password checking and array operations. It includes implementations for a strong password checker and finding the minimum possible absolute difference of an array. Test cases validating these functionalities are present in the `/test` directory.

### Usage

# Server Initialization

To start the server, run the following command:

```bash
npm run start

```

This command initiates the server, enabling the use of the implemented functionalities.

# Running Test Cases

To execute the test cases, use the following command:

```bash
npm run test

```

# Implementation Details

## Strong Password Checker

The implementation for the strong password checker can be found at the path `utils/strongPasswordChecker.js`. This function is designed specifically to evaluate the strength of a password based on predefined criteria. It provides specific information about the strength of the given password.

## Minimum Possible Absolute Difference of Array

The implementation for finding the minimum possible absolute difference of an array resides in `utils/minimalSubsetSumDiff.js`. This function computes the minimum absolute difference achievable by partitioning the array into two subsets and calculating their sums.

## Test Cases

Test cases dedicated to validating the correctness and functionality of the implemented features are situated in the `/test` directory. These test cases encompass various scenarios and edge cases to ensure the robustness of the functionalities.
